# Ocelot Talk - TypeScript

### Introduction

+ My assumed audience is a developer who has had some exposure to JavaScript but limited to no TypeScript.
+ I'm going to make the (subjective?) claim that TypeScript is a great option for running code on a JS engine.
+ I'm not advocating for (or against) running code on a JS engine.
+ This presentation is a git repo - feel free to clone it and play with it.
+ I'm not going to cover many advanced topics (e.g. type definition files).
+ Please post questions in the slack thread in **#ocelot-talks**, and I will address them in-between slides.
