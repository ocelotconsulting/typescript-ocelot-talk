# Dynamic Languages - Why?

+ "I have nothing against types - I just haven't found a type system that wasn't a total pain" - ???
+ Easier to learn.
+ Easier to explore and interact with (e.g. REPL).
+ Expanding existing schema?  No problem.  
+ More concise - less noisy.
    + `Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<String, List<String>>();`  
+ Third party APIs tend to be more straightforward.
+ No overly complex type-checker errors. 
+ Understanding the quirks of the type system can introduce accidental complexity and useless cognitive overhead.
