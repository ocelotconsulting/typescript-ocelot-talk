# The best of both worlds?

+ Our type system should feature:
    + Types with minimal noise and complexity.
    + Type inference wherever possible.
    + Immutability by default or at least easily supported.
    + Go dynamic and suppress invalid type checker error with minimal verbosity.
    + Type assertions when the type checker is wrong.
    + Protection against null reference errors.
