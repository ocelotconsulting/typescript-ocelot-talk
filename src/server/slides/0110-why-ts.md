# Why TS?

+ It looks as much like JS as possible - i.e you know JS if you know TS. It's nice to jump into a Node or Browser REPL
  and just write some code.
+ Null reference protection. Here's another botched quote: 'we can debate whether a language should have 
  a bottom value but I don't know anyone who thinks there should be two of them' - Douglas Crockford.
+ Compile time immutability without runtime immutability.
+ JS engines are everywhere. And JS, as a compile target, is often 'good enough'.
