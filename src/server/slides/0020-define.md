# What is TypeScript?

+ A superset of JavaScript (depending on your compiler settings).
+ JavaScript plus a type checker (compiler).
+ TypeScript preserves the semantics of JavaScript whenever possible and does a great job of keeping in sync with ES20xx.
+ With proper configuration, TS can prevent 
  [billion dollar mistake](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/) errors, e.g. 
  `cannot read property x of undefined`.
+ Works fine with any npm package, nearly all of which have typings available.
+ If you know TS, you know JS.  
+ If you like the "good parts" of JS, you'll probably like TypeScript as well.
